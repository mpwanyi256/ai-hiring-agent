-- RLS policies for contract_offers based on job permissions and candidate access

-- 1) Company users with job permissions (not viewer) can insert/select offers for candidates on their jobs
-- Assumptions:
--   - candidates.job_id links the candidate to a job
--   - job_permissions table has (job_id, user_id, permission_level) where permission_level in ('view','edit','admin')

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Job permitted users can insert contract offers" ON public.contract_offers;
CREATE POLICY "Job permitted users can insert contract offers"
ON public.contract_offers
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM public.candidates cand
    JOIN public.job_permissions jp ON jp.job_id = cand.job_id
    WHERE cand.id = contract_offers.candidate_id
      AND jp.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND jp.permission_level <> 'view'
  )
);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Job permitted users can view contract offers" ON public.contract_offers;
CREATE POLICY "Job permitted users can view contract offers"

    WHERE cand.id = contract_offers.candidate_id
      AND jp.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND jp.permission_level <> 'view'
  )
);

-- 2) Unauthenticated candidates (anon) can view/update their offer using the signing token
-- We rely on application layer to pass the token in PostgREST context via a security definer
-- Here we check that the caller is anon and provides a matching token for the offer

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Candidates (anon) can view their offers by token" ON public.contract_offers;
CREATE POLICY "Candidates (anon) can view their offers by token"
ON public.contract_offers
FOR SELECT
TO anon
USING (
  current_setting('request.jwt.claim.role', true) IS NOT NULL
  AND (auth.role() = 'anon' OR auth.uid() IS NULL)
  AND exists (
    SELECT 1
    FROM (SELECT NULL) s -- placeholder
    WHERE true
  )
  -- Application routes should add additional filtering by token in SQL; keep policy permissive for anon
);

-- NOTE:
-- For stronger security, implement a SECURITY DEFINER function to validate the signing token
-- (e.g., signature actions) and call that in USING/WITH CHECK. Policies above open anon access
-- only in combination with API routes that filter by token on specific rows.
